# Vinylog

A music discovery and review platform. Browse albums and artists sourced from Spotify, write reviews, curate lists, follow other users, and get AI-powered album recommendations.

**Live backend:** `https://vinylog.onrender.com`

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server proxies `/api/*` requests to the backend automatically.

## Architecture

### State management

Two separate layers:

- **`AuthContext`** (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) — identity only. Owns the current user, JWT token, login / signup / logout, follow / unfollow. Status: `loading | authed | anon`.
- **Redux Toolkit** (`src/store/`) — the current user's mutable data: lists, reviews, favourite albums. Survives navigation and updates reactively.
- **`AppDataLoader`** (`src/context/AppStateContext.tsx`) — bridges auth to Redux. When auth becomes `authed`, dispatches the three initial fetch thunks.

### Data fetching

All read-only / page-local data goes through `useFetch` (`src/hooks/useFetch.ts`) — a generic hook that manages `data`, `loading`, and `error` state, handles async cancellation with an `isMounted` flag, and re-fetches when a dependency array changes.

All backend calls are centralised in `src/api/`, one file per domain (`albums.ts`, `artists.ts`, `lists.ts`, `reviews.ts`, `users.ts`, `search.ts`, `recommend.ts`). Assembled into a single `api` object via `src/api/index.ts`.

### Routing

Protected routes are wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>`, which redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. Album links always navigate by `spotify_id`; `AlbumDetail` resolves it to a numeric DB id via `GET /albums/spotify/{id}` and then redirects — this keeps navigation stable even when DB ids shift after a Spotify sync.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server
npm run build        # Type-check + production build
npm run typecheck    # tsc without emit
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run test         # Vitest (single run)
npm run test:watch   # Vitest (watch)
npm run verify       # typecheck + lint + test
```

## Project 3 — Custom Hook (`useFetch`)

The core of the data layer is `useFetch`. It abstracts asynchronous side effects into a reusable, type-safe interface.

1. **State orchestration** — manages `data`, `loading`, and `error` simultaneously.
2. **Auto-execution** — triggers the fetcher on mount, removing `useEffect` boilerplate from components.
3. **Dependency synchronisation** — re-fetches only when the dependency array changes.
4. **Memory-leak prevention** — uses an `isMounted` flag to cancel state updates on unmounted components.
5. **Manual override** — exposes `setData` for optimistic updates without a server round-trip.

## Project 5 — Backend Integration

### Backend

Custom FastAPI on Render (`https://vinylog.onrender.com`). No Firebase or Supabase — all endpoints are JWT-protected REST routes backed by a PostgreSQL database. Music data is synced from the Spotify Web API on demand.

### Auth

- JWT email/password via `AuthContext`
- `getMe` called on app mount — session restored from `localStorage` token across page reloads
- `ProtectedRoute` redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Logout available in Settings

### Services layer

`src/services/` is the assignment-required public interface — thin re-exports over `src/api/`:

| File | Exports |
|---|---|
| `src/services/api.ts` | `api`, `setAuthToken`, `UnauthorizedError` |
| `src/services/auth.ts` | `authService` (alias for `api`) |
| `src/services/backend-config.ts` | `BACKEND_BASE_URL` |
